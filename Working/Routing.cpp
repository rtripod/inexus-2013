 //  We pick the the point with the lowest cost on the OPEN list
 //    If there are no more points on the OPEN list then we stop looping
 //  Put the point on the CLOSE list
 //  We call this point "current"
 //  Examine every point adjacent to it, for each of those points:
 //    If it is OPEN we check if we can get to it faster from "current" and if so chenge current to the pathParent of the point
 //    If it is NONE we make "current" the pathParent of the point
 //	 If it is GOAL we set atGoal to true
 //	 If it is CLOSED we've already considered it completely and so do nothing
 //Finish if there are no points left that cost less to get to than the goal
